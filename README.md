# neonSolarSystem
The neon Solar System Simulation is a solar system viewer based on pure CSS.
It has retro looks and colors look astounding. It is light weight as absolutly no images are used.
Also Number of years and days passed are also shown to have an idea. The numbers start from the day the project was built.
Give it a try. Worth a look.
